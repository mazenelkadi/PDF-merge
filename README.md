# PDF-merge

This script provides an easy way to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF. It allows users to select the PDF files they wish to merge and specify a filename and location for the merged PDF. This tool is useful for combining documents, such as reports, presentations, or e-books, into a single PDF file for easier handling and distribution. The user interface is straightforward, using tkinter file dialogs for file selection and saving.
